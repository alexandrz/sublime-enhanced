# SublimeEnhanced

Set of plugins for beloved sublime text editor.

This set of plugins were designed for 3 purposes:

  1. Mouseless usage of sublime
  2. Navigation (in code and files) improvement
  2. Common micro-tasks automation

For most people it will be convinient to cherry-pick one or two packages of
sublime-enhanced that will be useful for them. If you feel like hacker and have
a free day you can try full installation.

### Default keybinding activation

Keymaps listed in readmes are disabled by default. You should add next line to your
"User/Preferences.sublime-settings" file ("Preferences: Settings - User" in command
palette) to enable those keybindings.

```
"sublime_enhanced_keybindings": true,
```


### WARNING

Please read [readme-warning.md](https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-enhanced/blob/master/readme-warning.md),
[readme-usage.md](https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-enhanced/blob/master/readme-usage.md),
and [readme-keymap.md](https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-enhanced/blob/master/readme-keymap.md)
before full installation. Sublime-enhanced has a lot of unobviuos behavior and
keyboard shortcuts that replace default sublime's behavior which is partially covered by these files.
